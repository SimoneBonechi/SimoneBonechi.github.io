### Abstract
Deep learning is widely applied in bioinformatics and biomedical imaging, due to its ability to perform various clinical tasks automatically and accurately. In particular, the application of deep learning techniques for the automatic identification of glomeruli in histopathological kidney images can play a fundamental role, offering a valid decision support system tool for the automatic evaluation of the Karpinski metric. This will help clinicians in detecting the presence of sclerotic glomeruli in order to decide whether the kidney is transplantable or not. In this work, we implemented a deep learning framework to identify and segment sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli from scanned Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of human kidney biopsies. The experiments were conducted on a new dataset collected by both the Siena and Trieste hospitals. The images were segmented using the DeepLab V2 model, with a pre-trained ResNet101 encoder, applied to 512 Ã— 512 patches extracted from the original WSIs. The results obtained are promising and show a good performance in the segmentation task and a good generalization capacity, despite the different coloring and typology of the histopathological images. Moreover, we present a novel use of the CD10 staining procedure, which gives promising results when applied to the segmentation of sclerotic glomeruli in kidney tissues.
