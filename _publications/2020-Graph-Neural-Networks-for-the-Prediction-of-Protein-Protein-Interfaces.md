### Abstract
Binding site identification allows to determine the function-ality and the quaternary structure of protein–protein complexes. Variousapproaches to this problem have been proposed without reaching a viablesolution. Representing the interacting peptides as graphs, a correspon-dence graph describing their interaction can be built. Finding the maxi-mum clique in the correspondence graph allows to identify the secondarystructure elements belonging to the interaction site. Although the max-imum clique problem is NP-complete, Graph Neural Networks make foran approximation tool that can solve the problem in affordable time. Ourexperimental results are promising and suggest that this direction shouldbe explored further.
