I graduated in Information Engineering at the Department of Information Engineering and Mathematical Sciences of the University of Siena (2014) where I then obtained my PhD, during which I also spent a period as a visiting PhD at the University of Copenhagen (2018).
After two years of PostDoc, first at the University of Tuscia, and then at the University of Pisa, I am now a researcher at the Department of Social, Political and Cognitive Sciences of the University of Siena. My research activity is focused on Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, with particular reference to data analysis, computer vision and image processing. I am the author of over 25 publications in international journals and conference proceedings and I also carry out editorial activities as Associated Editor for the journal Neurocomputing.
